# dev Directory

This directory houses files for instant prototyping and testing different use cases of the Base Table component. Please visit [Vue CLI 3 Instant Prototyping documentation](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/prototyping.html) about instant prototyping. Also be advised the `@vue/cli-service-global` dependency has already been installed. Just run `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`) on the project root to serve the directory contents.
